- Change admin view to use User Controls which are dynamically added as a tab page (https://stackoverflow.com/a/5796396)
- Change admin view to use a table of some sort instead of whatever this is
- Create open file dialog
- Make admin cards not be a "group" anymore, but something else entirely
- Investigate use of zeromq for message sending OR Make messages specific to one controller instead of all messages being broadcasts
- More statistics
	- Amount of times a game has been played
	- Amount of current players per game
	- Amount of occupable spots (sum all max player amounts)
	- Amount of cards handed out
- Make one way of sending broadcast messages (e.g. "game paused" and "card inserted" use different methods)
- If it is possible: support multiple card readers acting as one
